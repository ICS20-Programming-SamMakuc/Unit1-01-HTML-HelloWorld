    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Sam.</p>
    <h3>My favourite passtime is playing basketball</h3>
    <p>I like playing basketball because I find it fun and I can play with my friends, I also like it        because it is a sport that makes focus and be active. </p>
    <h3>My least favorite subject is religion</h3>
    <p>I don't like religion right now because it feels that the teachers are just trying to add 
     enough work to last the whole semester, we also don't really learn much about religion in that 
     class either.</p>
